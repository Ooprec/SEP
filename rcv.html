<p id="Ernesto"><b>Why is Ranked-Choice voting important?</b></p>

<div>
<p id="Anwhy">RCV (or Ranked-Choice Voting) is an alternative voting system used throughout the world to promote more “consensus-based” candidates. It has been used in the United States since the early 20th century, famously in New York City as a means of preventing political corruption in the 1920s. Closer to home, RCV is going to be used in the Charlottesville City Council elections as of June 2025. Ranked-choice voting is a growing movement that supports more compromise among the electorate by seeking consensus rather than popularity in candidates.
